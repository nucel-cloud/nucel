## Introduction

Nucel <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(New-cel)</span> is an **open-source deployment platform** for modern web applications, designed for easy deployment without vendor lock-in,
ensuring you maintain full ownership of your infrastructure.

Nucel has different parts:

<Cards>

<Card icon={<CpuIcon className="text-purple-300" />} title='Deployment Packages'>

Handles infrastructure as code for Next.js, SvelteKit, and React Router deployments with optimized AWS patterns.

</Card>

<Card icon={<PanelsTopLeft className="text-blue-300" />} title='Cloud Infrastructure'>

Currently leverages AWS (CloudFront, Lambda, S3) with plans for GCP, Azure, and Cloudflare support.

</Card>

<Card icon={<Database />} title='Framework Adapters'>

Custom adapters for each framework ensuring optimal performance and feature compatibility on AWS.

</Card>

<Card icon={<Terminal />} title='Nucel CLI'>

A command line tool to deploy applications with a single command, handling all infrastructure complexity.

### Terminology

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define and manage your infrastructure using code instead of manual processes. Nucel uses Pulumi for IaC with zero configuration required.

**Stacks:** Isolated deployment environments (development, staging, production) with independent resources and configurations.

## Automatic Installation

A minimum version of Node.js 22 is required.

```bash tab="npm"
npm install -g @nucel.cloud/cli
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm add -g @nucel.cloud/cli
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn global add @nucel.cloud/cli
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun add -g @nucel.cloud/cli
```

### Your First Deployment

Deploy your application with a single command:

```bash
# In your project directory
nucel deploy
```

Nucel will:
- Detect your framework automatically
- Build your application
- Provision AWS infrastructure
- Deploy to a CloudFront URL

<Callout title='From Existing Codebase?'>

    Nucel works with existing Next.js, SvelteKit, and React Router projects. Just run `nucel deploy` in your project directory.

</Callout>

### Enjoy!

Your application is now live on AWS with:
- Global CDN distribution
- Auto-scaling serverless functions
- Enterprise-grade infrastructure
- Zero configuration required

Visit your CloudFront URL to see your deployed application.

```bash

```

## FAQ

Common questions you may encounter.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion id='change-stack' title="How to deploy to different environments?">
        You can deploy to different stacks (environments) using the `--stack` flag:

        ```bash
        # Deploy to development (default)
        nucel deploy

        # Deploy to production
        nucel deploy --stack production

        # Deploy to custom environment
        nucel deploy --stack feature-branch
        ```

        Each stack maintains its own isolated AWS resources and configuration.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='custom-domain' title="How to use a custom domain?">
        Add your custom domain in the `nucel.config.ts` file:

        ```ts title="nucel.config.ts"
        export default {
          domain: 'app.example.com',
          certificateArn: 'arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:...'
        }
        ```

        The certificate must be in us-east-1 region for CloudFront.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='environment-variables' title='How are environment variables handled?'>
        Nucel automatically loads environment variables from `.env` files:

        - `.env` - Always loaded
        - `.env.local` - Local overrides (git ignored)
        - `.env.[stack]` - Stack-specific variables
        - `.env.[stack].local` - Stack-specific local overrides

        Framework-specific public prefixes are automatically handled:
        - Next.js: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
        - SvelteKit: `PUBLIC_*`
        - React Router: `VITE_*`
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='costs' title="What are the AWS costs?">
        You only pay for AWS usage:
        - Lambda: $0.20 per 1M requests
        - CloudFront: $0.085 per GB transferred
        - S3: $0.023 per GB stored
        - No Nucel subscription fees

        Most applications cost less than $5/month for moderate traffic.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='preview-deployments' title="How to preview changes before deploying?">
        Use the `--preview` flag to see what changes will be made:

        ```bash
        nucel deploy --preview
        ```

        This shows a detailed diff of infrastructure changes without applying them.
