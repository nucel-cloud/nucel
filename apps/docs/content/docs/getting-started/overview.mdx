# Platform Overview

## What We're Building

This platform provides enterprise-grade deployment infrastructure for modern web applications on AWS. It combines the simplicity of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions with the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).

## The Problem We Solve

### For Developers
- **Complex AWS Setup**: Setting up Lambda, CloudFront, S3, and other services manually is time-consuming and error-prone
- **Framework Differences**: Each framework (Next.js, SvelteKit, React Router) has unique deployment requirements
- **Configuration Management**: Managing environment variables, domains, and infrastructure settings across environments
- **Lack of Standards**: No consistent deployment approach across different projects

### For Organizations
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Platforms like Vercel and Netlify control your infrastructure
- **Rising Costs**: PaaS solutions become expensive at scale
- **Limited Control**: Cannot customize infrastructure for specific requirements
- **Compliance Issues**: Data residency and security requirements may conflict with third-party platforms

## Our Solution

### 1. **Unified Deployment Platform**
Deploy any modern web framework to AWS with a single, consistent approach:
- Next.js with full App Router and ISR support
- SvelteKit with SSR and static site generation
- React Router v7 (Remix) with streaming and data loading

### 2. **Infrastructure as Code**
Built on Pulumi, providing:
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Reproducible deployments
- Rollback capabilities
- Infrastructure testing

### 3. **Cost Optimization**
Serverless architecture that scales to zero:
- Pay only for actual usage
- No idle server costs
- Automatic scaling
- Typical cost: $10-40/month for most applications

## Key Components

### Core Infrastructure

| Component | Purpose | Technology |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Compute** | Server-side rendering | AWS Lambda (ARM64) |
| **CDN** | Global content delivery | CloudFront |
| **Storage** | Static assets | S3 Buckets |
| **Database** | ISR cache (Next.js) | DynamoDB |
| **Queue** | Revalidation (Next.js) | SQS |
| **Monitoring** | Logs and metrics | CloudWatch |

### Package Architecture

```
@nucel.cloud/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pulumi-nextjs-aws/      # Next.js deployment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pulumi-sveltekit-aws/   # SvelteKit deployment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pulumi-react-router-aws/ # React Router deployment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nucel-cli/              # CLI tool
```

## How It Works

### 1. Build Phase
Each framework has a custom adapter that:
- Analyzes your application structure
- Optimizes the build for serverless deployment
- Separates static and dynamic content
- Creates Lambda-ready bundles

### 2. Infrastructure Phase
Pulumi provisions AWS resources:
- Creates S3 buckets for static assets
- Deploys Lambda functions for SSR
- Configures CloudFront for global distribution
- Sets up monitoring and logging

### 3. Deployment Phase
The platform:
- Uploads static assets to S3
- Deploys Lambda functions
- Invalidates CloudFront cache
- Returns your application URL
